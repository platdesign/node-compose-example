# node-compose-example

Example project using node-compose


# Install


```shell
$ git clone 
$ cd app && npm install
$ cd service-user && npm install
```

# Running node-compose

`node-compose` needs to be installed globally at this point.

Start node-compose shell with

```shell
$ node-compose
```


and open the monitor by executing

```shell
node-compose $ monitor -o
```

Now you are ready to go.
